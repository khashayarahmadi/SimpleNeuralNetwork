# SimpleNeuralNetwork
Neural networks are powerful machine learning models inspired by the human brain. In this overview, we'll discuss building a simple neural network using random initialization and NumPy in Python.
Define the Architecture: Start by defining the structure of your neural network. Specify the number of input nodes, hidden nodes, and output nodes. Randomly initialize the weights and biases for each layer using np.random.randn().

Forward Propagation: Implement the forward pass method, which computes the activations of each layer by performing matrix multiplications of inputs, weights, and adding biases. Apply activation functions like tanh() or sigmoid() to introduce non-linearity in the network.

Loss Function: Define a loss function to measure the difference between predicted outputs and actual targets. Common loss functions include mean squared error or cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.

Backward Propagation (Training): Implement the backpropagation algorithm to update the weights and biases based on the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network parameters. Use gradient descent or its variants to minimize the loss iteratively.

Training Loop: Iterate through the dataset for multiple epochs, where each epoch involves a forward pass to compute predictions, calculation of loss, and backward pass for updating weights and biases. Adjust the learning rate to control the step size during parameter updates.

Predictions: Once trained, the neural network can make predictions on new data by performing a forward pass through the network and interpreting the output activations. The predicted output can be obtained by applying argmax or thresholding based on the task.

Evaluation: Assess the performance of the neural network on a separate validation or test dataset by measuring metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. Fine-tune hyperparameters like learning rate or hidden layer size to optimize performance.

By leveraging random initialization for parameters and utilizing NumPy for efficient numerical computations, you can build a simple neural network capable of learning patterns in data and making predictions. Keep experimenting with different architectures and training strategies to improve the network's performance. ðŸš€ðŸ§ ðŸ’»
